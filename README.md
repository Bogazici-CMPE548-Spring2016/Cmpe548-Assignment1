# Assignment 1

Q1) In this question we were asked to use inversion method to sample polar coordinates(r,theta) inside the unit circle. For this purpose I calculated the CDF of the probability distribution of r, which gave me P(r) = r^2. From the inversion method I had to take the inverse of the function, P^(-1)(y) = y^(1/2). Uniformly getting y value and then taking its square root gave me the r values of the polar coordinates. For the theta value I used uniform random function of numpy library. Then I drew them on a figure. From the ![alt tag](https://github.com/metehandoyran/Assignment-1/blob/master/figure_1.png?raw=true) you can see the result.
